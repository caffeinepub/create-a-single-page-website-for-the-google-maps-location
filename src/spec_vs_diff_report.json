  "summary": "Diff updates `categoryBannerImages` in `frontend/src/content/business.ts` to include `salad` and `soup` banner paths and retains `drinks`. However, the diff does not add/update the required static image assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`, and it does not provide evidence that the drinks images were actually edited to remove beer imagery. Additional unrelated changes appear in `business.ts` (e.g., menu item image resolution path logic) and unrelated metadata files.",

      "requirement": "Ensure Drinks categories (“Hot & Cold Bar”, “Fresh Juice Seasonal”) use a drinks banner image with no beer imagery, and update banner mappings in `frontend/src/content/business.ts` accordingly.",
      "reason": "While `categoryBannerImages.drinks` points to `/assets/generated/menu-category-drinks.dim_1600x900.jpg`, the diff provides no evidence that the underlying drinks assets were updated to remove beer imagery, and the truncated `menu` section prevents confirming the specific categories (“Hot & Cold Bar”, “Fresh Juice Seasonal”) are mapped to `drinks` (or have correct `image` fields) without changing names/prices.",

      "requirement": "Update banner mapping so “Lawazmat (Salads)”, “Salad” use a salad banner image and “Soup” uses a soup banner image in `frontend/src/content/business.ts`.",
      "reason": "`categoryBannerImages` includes `salad` and `soup` paths, but the `menu: [...]` structure where category objects and their `image`/mapping would be applied is truncated, so the diff summary does not conclusively show those specific categories are wired to these keys/paths.",
