  "summary": "Diff appears to implement the requested presentation updates: menu item cards no longer show food photos, logo references updated to the new transparent-fixed assets in header/hero, favicon updated, and muted text color tokens brightened. However, the diff summary also indicates several unrelated/unrequested structural and content changes (e.g., filtering/removing the “Deals” category, rewriting menu image paths to 4K helpers, adding new section-visibility/navigation behavior, and adding placeholder hooks/config changes).",
