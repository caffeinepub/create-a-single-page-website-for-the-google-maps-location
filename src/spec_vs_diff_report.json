However, the diff does not provide clear evidence that the “Built with Caffeine” credit/link is fully removed from all UI, and it does not include the actual updated logo asset file. The diff also introduces unrelated behavior (e.g., filtering out a “Deals” category) beyond the stated non-goals.",

      "reason": "The provided modified files (App.tsx, SiteHeader.tsx, MenuCategoryGrid.tsx) show logo/path changes and other UI logic, but the diff summary does not show the footer/credit component or any removal of text/link containing “Built with”, “Caffeine”, or “caffeine.ai”. With App.tsx truncated and no footer-specific diff shown, there isn’t sufficient evidence that the credit/link was removed everywhere.",
