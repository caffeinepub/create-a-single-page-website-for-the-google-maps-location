  "summary": "The diff implements the requested visual/styling changes (logo light-green badge, softer off-white typography, and subtle entrance/hover animations) and indicates removal of Caffeine credit and heart usage. However, it also introduces multiple unrequested functional/content changes (e.g., filtering/removing the “Deals” menu category, WhatsApp ordering + variant dialog, new icons/docs/config tweaks), some of which may violate the constraint to not change existing menu content.",
