  "summary": "Single-page marketing website for HOTEL NASRA DA with HND branding; keep the existing menu text exactly unchanged, and currently remove/hide the per-menu-item photos from the Menu item cards; fix the HND logo to have a properly removed/transparent background; update overall text colors to be lighter for readability on the dark theme.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Menu content should be stored in the centralized content configuration (same TS object/file as other business details) and rendered as text (no menu image dependency).",
    "Potential scope change: user requests images for each menu item, which conflicts with the prior requirement that the menu be text-only (no menu image dependency). Clarify/decide whether to allow per-item images and how they will be sourced/stored.",
    "Branding update: add/use an 'HND' logo in the header/hero start area and remove/avoid the existing map logo.",
    "Menu item imagery requirement: each menu item image must be distinct; avoid reusing the same photo across items.",
    "User requested a navigation-driven/conditional rendering layout: keep Contact/Location on the main view and reveal other sections on button click (instead of showing all sections at once).",
    "Ordering UX requirement: add a per-menu-item 'Order' CTA that deep-links to WhatsApp (wa.me / click-to-chat) with a prefilled message including the item name (and optionally price), so the user can order that specific item.",
    "Ordering UX enhancement: if an item has multiple variants (e.g., Half/Full), the Order flow should first collect the user’s selection and include the chosen variant (and corresponding price if shown) in the WhatsApp pre-filled message.",
    "User requirement update: ensure the page/site background is not transparent (avoid unintended transparency in global layout/background layers).",
    "User requirement: menu item naming may need to be standardized with an 'HND' prefix before item names (confirm exact formatting: e.g., 'HND <Item Name>').",
    "Menu imagery requirement clarification: for each written menu item (e.g., Pizza), display the matching item photo alongside it (no generic/full-menu image usage)."

    "Images are not displaying correctly on the site (user reported missing/incorrect image rendering).",
    "Build/deployment failing due to a \"System configuration error\" (platform/system-level error).",
    "User reports the website background is transparent and should be fixed (should render as solid/dark background).",
    "Homepage/section reveal behavior is incorrect: when clicking navigation buttons, sections appear in a way that still feels like everything is on one long scrolling page; user wants content to be conditionally shown per button (not all sections visible at once)."
