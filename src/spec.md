# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove all “Built with Caffeine” UI credit/link and ensure the HND logo renders cleanly and consistently across the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove any visible “Built with …”, “Caffeine”, or “caffeine.ai” text and any outbound link to caffeine.ai from the UI (including the footer).
- Clean up any leftover unused imports/variables caused by removing the credit label.
- Replace the HND logo asset with a corrected transparent version and update all logo usages (header logo, hero logo, and menu category watermark) to reference the same corrected asset path.

**User-visible outcome:** The app shows no Caffeine-related credit/link anywhere, and the HND logo displays with a clean transparent background (no box/edges) consistently in the header, hero area, and menu category watermark on mobile and desktop.
