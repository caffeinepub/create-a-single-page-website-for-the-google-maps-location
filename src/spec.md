# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Clean up footer/UI credits and iconography, refine the logo presentation with a light-green background treatment, and improve dark-theme typography and motion with subtle animations.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove any “Built with … using caffeine.ai” credit/label from the UI, including removing any outbound caffeine.ai link from the footer while keeping the remaining footer content unchanged.
- Remove any heart emoji or heart icon/symbol used inline in the UI, keeping all user-facing text in English.
- Update the HND logo display in header and hero to sit on a clearly visible light-green background badge/container while keeping the logo image itself intact and clean on the dark theme.
- Adjust site-wide text colors away from pure white to a softer off-white with readable muted text hierarchy, and add subtle entrance/hover/focus animations without changing existing content/sections or menu item text.

**User-visible outcome:** The site no longer shows any caffeine.ai build credit or heart symbol, the HND logo appears on a light-green badge, text looks less harsh on the dark theme, and the UI feels more lively via subtle animations.
